## Database Structure

### Key Tables:

1. **Orders** - Stores order information with points tracking
2. **OrderItems** - Individual items with points earned
3. **CampaignPoints** - Campaign-specific points for each reseller
4. **Products** - Product information with points per unit
5. **Campaigns** - Campaign information and settings
6. **CampaignResellers** - Reseller-campaign assignments

### Points Calculation Logic:

```sql
-- Points per order item = Quantity Ã— PointsPerUnit
-- Total order points = Sum of all order item points
-- Campaign points = Sum of all order points for that campaign
-- Available points = Total earned - Points used for vouchers
```
