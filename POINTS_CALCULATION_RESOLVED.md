# Points Calculation Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Summary
The reseller points calculation system had several issues:
1. **Incorrect OrderItems PointsEarned** - Points were not calculated as `Quantity × PointsPerUnit`
2. **Incorrect Orders TotalPointsEarned** - Order totals didn't match sum of order items
3. **Missing CampaignPoints Records** - Campaign-specific points were not properly tracked
4. **Inconsistent Data** - Database had mismatched values

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Fix Script (`fix_points_calculation.sql`)

- **Fixed Orders TotalPointsEarned**: Updated order totals to match sum of order items

- **Verified Calculations**: Added comprehensive verification queries

### 2. Enhanced Backend (`backend/Controllers/Reseller/OrderController.cs`)

- **Improved Endpoint**: `POST /api/reseller/order/calculate-points` - Better error handling and validation
- **Enhanced Logic**: Proper campaign points tracking and updates

### 3. Enhanced Frontend
